# Hospital-Analytics-Dashboard
> **Tools:** Power BI | Excel | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling  

📘 Introduction
Healthcare organizations increasingly rely on data analytics to monitor patient flow, optimize operational efficiency, control costs, and improve quality of care. Hospitals collect large volumes of patient, treatment, and billing information, but without proper analysis, these insights remain untapped.
This Power BI project transforms raw hospital data into an interactive analytics dashboard that supports strategic decision-making across patient engagement, financial performance, claim processing, and geographical distribution of services.


## 📌 Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
1.	To create a unified Power BI dashboard for patient, claim, and revenue insights.
2.	To analyse operational efficiency through encounter types, weekly patient flow, and gender trends.
3.	To evaluate financial performance using cost distribution, charge decomposition, and revenue indicators.
4.	To provide location-based insights using geographic mapping and city-wise ranking.
5.	To empower decision-makers with interactive slicers (Ethnicity, Weekday, City, Country, Patient Type, Charges).

## ❓ Problem Statement
 
 Hospitals often struggle with:
 - Limited visibility into daily/weekly patient volumes
 - Difficulty tracking gender-wise trends and encounter types
 - Weak understanding of charge distribution across cities
 - Lack of clarity in claim status allocations (high/medium/low cost)
 - Inefficient monitoring of revenue performance vs targets
 - No consolidated system that connects patients, geography, and financials into a single source of truth.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Gathered data of https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/hospital-patient-records from Maven Analytics Portal  

2. **Data Consolidation:**  
   Combined monthly Excel sheets, removed subtotals and redundant rows.  

3. **Automation (Macros):**  
   Automated repetitive formatting tasks like column alignment and styling.  

4. **Data Cleaning (Power Query):**  
   Filled missing values, standardized text formats, corrected data types.  

5. **Data Transformation:**  
   Added calculated flag columns and harmonized field names.  

6. **Data Integration:**  
   Appended cleaned datasets into a unified dataset of https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/hospital-patient-records from Maven Analytics Portal)for visualization.

## Calculated Measures

- Total Patients = COUNTROWS(patients)
- Total Claimcost = SUM(encounters[CLAIM_COST])
- Total Cities = COUNTA(patients[CITY])
- Total Charges = SUM(procedures[MEDICAL CHARGES])
- Total BaseCost = SUM(encounters[BASE_ENCOUNTER_COST])
- Total BaseCost = SUM(encounters[BASE_ENCOUNTER_COST])
- Avg Cost per Day = DIVIDE(SUM(procedures[MEDICAL CHARGES]), SUM(procedures[Days_Admitted]))
- Average Claimcost = AVERAGE(encounters[CLAIM_COST])
- Average Charges = AVERAGE(procedures[MEDICAL CHARGES])
- AVERAGE BASE COST = AVERAGE(encounters[BASE_ENCOUNTER_COST])

---

## Calculated Tables

### Calendar Table:
- The Calendar table provides a complete date structure with Year, Quarter, Month, and Date fields. It enables accurate time intelligence (YTD, MTD, QTD) and ensures all measures work consistently across time.
### Measures Tables:
- The Measure Values table stores all DAX measures used in the dashboard, such as totals, averages, revenues, and ranking metrics. It keeps all calculations organized in one place, making the data model cleaner, easier to manage, and more efficient.

---

## Calculated Columns

- CLAIM_STATUS = IF(encounters[CLAIM_COST] >= 20000, "High Cost",IF(encounters[CLAIM_COST] >= 10000 && encounters[CLAIM_COST] < 20000,"Medium Cost","Low Cost"))
- BALANCE_CLAIMCOST = encounters[CLAIM_COST]-encounters[BASE_ENCOUNTER_COST]
